### 1.Prgramming
You must have a solid knowledge of programming

I recommend starting with [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

then you have to learn how to code using C prgramming language
I recommend to studying (not just reading) the following books
[C Programming A modern Approach](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504)
[Understanding and Using C Pointers](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Using-Pointers-Techniques-Management/dp/1449344186)

programming languages need practice
I recommend practicing on websites like
[Hacker Rank]
[IndiaBix]
[San Foundry]


### 2.Discrete mathematics
It is an prerequisite of Data structure and algorithms
I recommend [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) or the course of [Dr/Waleed A. Yousef (Waleed Yousef)](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef) [Descrete Mathimatics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoK2Lr1miEm_WKBBBHUQJRXaumduqkM4S)


### 3.Data structure and algorithms
It is one of the most important topics in computer scinece and it is a mendatory topic to be a good software engineer

I recommend starting with studying [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)
then the course of [Dr/Waleed A. Yousef (Waleed Yousef)](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef) [Introduction to data sturcure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGgzFPRLl4o&list=PLoK2Lr1miEm-5zCzKE8siQezj9rvQlnca)
then the course [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) or [Algorithms Specialization

](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?page=9)


### 4.OS
You have to get solid knowledge of Operating Systems consepts

I recommend [CS-537: Introduction to Operating Systems](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/)

### 5.Degital Design
You need to have a good knowledge of this field
I recommend the course of [Dr/Waleed A. Yousef (Waleed Yousef)](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef) [Logic design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgEOfxbbS_4&list=PLZNz7wrFA85Antgz1o79xCn1O2nwDEkLH)


### 6.Others
you need to have a basic knowledge of networks, OOP, and database
