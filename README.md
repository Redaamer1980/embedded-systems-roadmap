## Prerequisites
The Embedded Systems software engineer need to have solid knowledge of `CS`.

And a good knowledge of `degital design` and `electronics`.

## Computer Science
- [Intro to CS](#intro-to-cs)
- [The C Programming Language](#the-c-programming-language)
- [Data Structure and Algotithms](#data-structure-and-algotithms)
- [Problem Solving Mindset](#problem-solving-mindset)
- [Operating Systems](#operating-systems)
- [others](#others)

### Intro to CS
#### study one of the following courses (CS50 is recommended)
these courses will give you the basic knowledge of the fields of computer science and programming
- [CS50: Computer Science Courses and Programs from Harvard](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

### The C Programming Language
#### study the following books
first one is to teach you the C language. You can follow playlist linke [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGMB4Fhh50&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhX6r2uhhlubuF5QextdCSM)
second is to give you a solid knowledge in pointers (the most important topic in C programming)
- [C Programming A modern Approach](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504)
- [Understanding and Using C Pointers](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Using-Pointers-Techniques-Management/dp/1449344186)

#### practice writing C programs on the following websites
- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [IndiaBix](https://www.indiabix.com/)
- [San Foundry](https://www.sanfoundry.com/)

### Data Structure and Algotithms
#### study the following book
this book will give you the basic knowledge of the field of data structure and algorithms
- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)

#### study one of the following cources of discrete mathematics (Dr Waleed is recommended)
these courses are not mandatory but it is better to study first one (dr waleed)
- [MA 112: Discrete Mathematics I (logic, basics, and foundations)](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DiscreteMathematics)
- [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/)
- [Descrete Mathematics Neso-Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2b2Vb-cYCs&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhqJPDXcvYlLfXPh37L89g3)

#### study the following course
this course will give you what you need to implement the famouse data structures with C
- [CS 214: Data Structures](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DataStructures)

#### if you want to get advanced study one of the follwoing courses
these course will change your mindset but these courses are not mendatory you can learn from problem soulving
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) 
- [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?page=9)


### Problem Solving Mindset
#### you need to practice your mind how to solve programmable problems
there are alot of sheets and ways to practice but this sheet is, i think, enough
I recommend [Al-Azhar sheet](https://sites.google.com/view/azharicpc/) and go with its progress

#### you can learn DS & ALGO through solving
- [LeetCode](https://interview.leetcode.com/interview/?gclid=CjwKCAjwvNaYBhA3EiwACgndggVHD-TZV0xhKDm30cLEFvO-hVww5R5XobFp5Pe4b8m87O153xU22hoCHQQQAvD_BwE) is a good website to practice and learn

### Operating Systems
#### you can follow the [Core Systems](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#core-systems) in [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu)
os is one of the most important fields that you should have a good knowledge in it because the [RTOS](#rtos) is just an operating system

### Others
#### you can get some knowledge about
- Networks
- OOP
- Data-bases
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education]()


## Digital Design
#### study the following course
- [CS 221: Digital Design](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DigitalDesign)

## Electronics
#### if you feel that you have enough knowledge, skip this section.
#### you can return to the following book
- [The Art of Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266)
